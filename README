blogpit
===============

Blogpit is a blog storage backend that stores articles and sections for a blog
within a Git repository. This implementation is intended to replace the one used
by django-blogpit. 


Dependencies
---------------
- libgit2 0.16.0
- python, to build the python bindings

We link statically against libgit2, so you need to have a static version
of the library (libgit2.a).
